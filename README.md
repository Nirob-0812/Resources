# AI Learning Roadmap for Beginners

Welcome to the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence (AI)! If you're new to programming and AI, don't worry. This roadmap is designed to guide you step-by-step, starting from the very basics. Remember, learning AI is a journey, and the most important thing is to enjoy the process. Let's get started!

## 1. **Start with Basic Python**

Python is the most popular language for AI, and it's beginner-friendly! Start with these topics:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Learn about integers, strings, floats, and more.
- **Control Structures**: Get comfortable with `if` statements, loops (`for`, `while`).
- **Functions**: Understand how to create and use functions.
- **Basic Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
